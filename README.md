# Kattis_CP4_Solutions
My solutions to some of the Kattis problems listed in Competitive Programming 4.

Note that some of the problems attempted were listed in CP3 but not CP4s, there a small number of UVA solutions as well.

The C++ code is written to be compiled using with g++ (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04) 9.3.0
<pre>g++ -std=c++17 kattis_xxx.cpp -o kattis_xxx && kattis_xxx</pre>

Python code is executed using Cpython 3.8+ 
<pre>/bin/python3 kattis_xxx.py</pre>

## Documentation
The solution files contain documentation of several different categories.

#### Observation: 
A key insight into the question or our currently considered method that might be needed to come up with a correct algorithm or improve the efficiency of an algorithm.

#### Idea:
A new approach to the problem. Could include viewing the problem from a different angle.

#### Debugging:
Descriptions of bugs that one could encounter, possibly including edge cases.

#### Optimisations:
Other micro-optimisations that are not important enough to be considered ideas or observations.

#### Design:
A way we implement an idea in code to keep the code simple and easy to write.

#### Time and Memory Complexity:
My analysis of the algorithmic order of growth - might not be correct but I tried my best :(

Note that as I solve more problems, what would be a design or observation in the past might no longer be the main focus and thus not discussed.
