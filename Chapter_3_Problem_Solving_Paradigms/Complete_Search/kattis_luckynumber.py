Kattis - luckynumber
Observe that for each lucky number L of length n, L//10 is a lucky number of length n-1. What this means is that
we can compute the lucky numbers iteratively, storing all lucky numbers of length n-1 a vector, we can then
try all L*10 + j for all lucky numbers L of length n-1 and j in [0..9] as candidates for lucky numbers, checking
if the result is divisible by n. We can pre-compute the number of n length lucky numbers and store it as a vector.

Note actually that since the number of lucky numbers eventually ends to zero, even if the bounds for n were
1e18 or something, it would be okay as we would just need to output zero if n was greater than a certain threshold,
only refering to the array if n is less than the threshold.
